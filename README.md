INTRODUCTION
  
  The purpose of our project was to see which variables such as: BMI, High Blood Pressure, Smoking, and Activitiy have a correlation with Diabetes. In indentfying one of these variables would help prevent or diagnosed Diabetes a lot sooner. We believe that BMI would be the best variable to predict if someone would most likely be diagnosed with Diabetes.

Discription of Data
 
  The dataset had over 70,000 rows of data relating to health factors. The data was then narrowed down to 4 health factors that could have a potential impact on diabetes: BMI, High Blood Pressure Smoking and Activity. High Blood Pressure, Smoking and Activity were set either to 0 or 1. 0 being set as regular blood pressure, non-smoker, or non-active for the respective variables. 1 being set as High blood pressure, smoker or active. BMI number ranges from 19-24 as being healthy weight,25-29 as overweight, and 30-35 being obeses.

PIE CHARTS
  We created pie charts to show the relationships between the 4 factors that we chose and diabetes. High Blood Pressure and BMI seemed to have the most relationship to diabetes.

Statistic Analysis
  After running our data we saw that High Blood Pressure had the highest correlation to Diabetes at .38. Second in running was BMI with a correlation of .293733

CONCLUSION

  It has always been a belief  that being overweight or obeses would tend to be at risk for developing diabetes. Although we beleive that BMI is just as important, High Blood Pressure had the highest correlation out of all the factors that we chose. Therefore we have to reject our main hypothsis and accept our null that BMI is not the best indicator for someone to develope Diabetes. We hope with this information that medical proffesional would be able to diagnose an individual with diabetes in the early stage. Being able to diagnose Diabetes in the early stage, we would be able to give an individual a chance to live a normal healthy life.

# Diabetes Risk Factors Analysis

## Introduction

The purpose of our project was to see which of the following variables have a correlation with Diabetes: BMI, High Blood Pressure, Smoking, and Physical Activitiy. 

We believe that BMI is the most likely predictor in the onset of Diabetes.

## Description of Data

The dataset had over 70,000 rows of data relating to health factors. The data was then narrowed down to 4 health factors that we thought could have a potential impact on diabetes: BMI, High Blood Pressure, Smoking, and Physical Activity. 

High Blood Pressure, Smoking, and Physical Activity were set either to 0 or 1. 0 indicates regular blood pressure, non-smoker, or non-active for the respective variables. 1 indicates high blood pressure, smoker or physically active. BMI is a number whose categories are as follows: below 19 is underweight, 19-24 is healthy weight, 25-29 is overweight, 30-35 is obese, and above 35 is extremely obese.

## Pie Charts
We created pie charts to show the relationships between the 4 factors that we chose and diabetes. High Blood Pressure and BMI seemed to have the most relationship to diabetes.

## Statistical Analysis
After running our data we saw that the primary factor is High Blood Pressure with the highest correlation to Diabetes at r = 0.38. The secondary factor was BMI with a correlation of r = 0.29.

## Conclusion
Our original hypothesis was that being overweight or obese would put someone at higher risk for developing Diabetes. Although we believe that BMI is just as important, High Blood Pressure had the highest correlation out of all the factors that we examined. Therefore we have to reject our main hypothesis and accept our null which is that **BMI is not the best indicator for someone to develop Diabetes**. We hope with this information that medical profesionals would be able to diagnose an individual with Diabetes in the earlier stages. By being able to diagnose Diabetes in the early stage, we would be able to give individuals a chance to live a normal healthy life.
